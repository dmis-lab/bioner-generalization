The O
first O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O

a O
larger O

at O
two O
years O
. O

Ultrasound O

did O
not O

any O

or O

. O

The O
swelling O
increased O
in O
size O
over O

. O

At O
12 O
years O
, O
lymphoscintigraphy O
revealed O
decreased O
lymphatic O
draining O
in O
both O
legs O
, O
which O
was O
more O
profound O
in O
the O
right O
leg O
. O

The O
second O
patient O
was O
treated O
for O
pulmonary O

at O
age O
2 O
months O
. O

Postoperative O
, O
the O
patient O
suffered O
from O
protein O

, O
hypothyroidism O
, O
recurrent O

and O
bilateral O

the O

we O
propose O
that O

The O

associated O
with O

who O
showed O

profound O
deficits O
of O
the O

this O

We O
found O
that O

that O
