constantly O
exposed O
to O
several O
noxious O
stimuli O
, O
irritants O
and O
allergens O
. O

However O
, O
oral O
contact O
pathologies O
are O
not O
frequently O
seen O
because O
of O
the O
relative O
resistance O
of O
the O
oral O
mucosa O
to O
irritant O
agents O
and O
allergens O
due O
to O
anatomical O
and O

The O
spectrum O
of O
signs O

of O
oral O

broad O
and O
a O

contact O
cheilitis O
, O
geographic O

, O
oral O
lichenoid O
reactions O
, O
burning O

The O
main O
etiological O
factors O
causing O
OCA O
are O
dental O
materials O
, O

products O
, O
as O

The O
personal O

in O
both O
acute O

, O
patch O
tests O
can O
play O
a O
pivotal O
role O
in O
the O
diagnosis O

However O
, O
patch O
tests O
might O
have O
several O
pitfalls O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O

of O
metal O

and O
specifically O
the O
differences O
in O
their O
concentrations O
in O
oral O

in O
standard O
preparation O
for O
patch O

and O
in O
the O

might O
result O
in O
either O
false O
positive O

negative O

or O
non O

. O

Another O
limitation O
of O
patch O
test O
results O
is O
the O
difficulty O
to O
assess O
the O
clinical O
relevance O
of O
haptens O
contained O
in O
dental O
materials O
and O
only O
the O
removal O
of O
dental O
materials O
or O
the O
avoidance O
of O

The O
difficulty O
however O
in O
accepting O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
geographic O

as O
oral O
psoriasis O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
not O
all O

present O
psoriasis O
. O

Some O
authors O
believe O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O

would O
be O
much O
greater O
if O
psoriatic O
patients O
underwent O

any O
of O
the O

found O
to O
be O
anaemic O

The O
mean O
levels O

, O
however O
, O
slightly O
lower O
in O
the O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O

not O
play O
a O
primary O
role O
in O
the O
aetiology O

The O
most O

findings O
were O
the O

no O

An O
outstanding O
finding O
was O
the O

, O
making O
up O
less O

we O
undertook O

started O
in O
a O
child O
, O
usually O
an O
infant O
( O

months O
) O
, O
and O
then O
spread O
to O
one O
or O
several O
other O

of O
the O
family O
. O

It O
had O
an O
abrupt O
onset O
and O
was O
characterized O
by O
difficulties O
in O

, O
increased O
salivation O
, O
and O
irritability O
. O

Inflamed O
, O
hypertrophic O

were O
seen O
on O
the O
tip O
and O
the O
dorsolateral O
part O
of O
the O
tongue O
, O
some O
having O
a O
pseudopustular O
appearance O

There O
were O
no O

The O
acute O

A O
few O
days O
later O
, O
one O

experienced O
an O
intense O

on O
the O
tongue O
, O
with O
an O
increase O
and O
exacerbation O
caused O
by O
food O
intake O
, O
with O
the O
identical O
features O
of O
inflamed O

. O

The O
duration O
of O
the O
stomatitis O
was O
usually O
1 O

for O
the O
infants O
, O
but O
longer O
for O
some O

. O

The O

the O

Fissured O
tongue O
: O
a O
sign O
of O
tongue O
edema O
? O

Fissured O
tongue O
( O
FT O
) O
is O
a O
condition O
frequently O
seen O
in O
the O
general O
population O
. O

Clinically O
, O
FT O
is O
characterized O
by O
grooves O
that O
vary O
in O
depth O
and O
are O
noted O
along O
the O
dorsal O
and O
/ O
or O
dorsolateral O
aspects O
of O
the O
tongue O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
FT O
presents O
many O
enlarged O
, O
smooth O
filiform O
papillae O
and O
subepithelial O
inflammatory O
infiltration O
. O

Despite O
of O
many O
studies O
, O
the O
etiology O
of O
FT O
remains O
obscure O
. O

FT O
is O
believed O
to O
be O
a O
congenital O
anomaly O
associated O
with O
several O
disorders O
and O
with O
geographic O
tongue O
( O
GT O
) O
. O

We O
hypothesize O
that O
FT O
is O
not O
a O
congenital O
anomaly O
, O
and O
FT O
with O
swollen O
filiform O
papillae O
may O
represent O
edema O
in O
the O
subepithelial O
tissue O
of O
the O
tongue O
. O

According O
to O
the O
literature O
, O
the O
difference O
in O
prevalence O
among O
different O
age O
groups O
indicates O
that O
FT O
is O
not O
a O
congenital O
disorder O
. O

FT O
appears O
to O
occur O
more O
commonly O
in O
adults O
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
rare O
or O
not O
at O
all O
in O
children O
younger O
than O
10 O
years O
old O
. O

An O
association O
between O
FT O
and O
GT O
is O
well O
established O
in O
the O
literature O
, O
supporting O
the O
results O
of O
previous O
authors O
suggesting O
that O
FT O
might O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
GT O
. O

The O
most O
remarkable O
finding O
in O
the O
region O
of O
swollen O
papillae O
of O
FT O
samples O
has O
been O
the O
subepithelial O
infiltrates O
of O
polymorphonuclear O
leucocytes O
and O
lymphocytes O
causing O
the O
subepithelial O
edema O
. O

The O
clinically O
visible O
grooves O
and O
large O
edematic O
papillae O
clustered O
on O
the O
region O
of O
the O
fissures O
might O
be O
caused O
by O
the O
inflammation O
and O
edema O
underneath O
the O
epithelium O
. O

In O
the O
future O
, O
FT O
and O
GT O
must O
be O
researched O
together O
as O
two O
different O
entities O
of O
the O
same O
disease O
so O
that O
GT O
is O
a O
prestage O
of O
FT O
. O

The O
diagnosis O
of O
FT O
must O
be O
taken O
to O
consideration O
whether O
the O
tongue O
surface O
have O
smooth O
and O
swollen O
papillae O
or O
normal O

, O
it O
is O
characterized O
by O
erythemato O

A O
descriptive O
classification O
of O

of O
the O
fungiform O

on O
the O
tongue O
was O
developed O
using O
a O
9 O

point O
analogue O
scale O
where O
1 O
was O
considered O
normal O
and O
9 O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
severely O

. O

An O
opportunistic O
sample O

were O
classified O
as O
atopic O

not O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
personal O
history O
of O
asthma O

or O

. O

An O
examination O
of O
the O
tongue O
was O
performed O
using O
the O
classification O
and O
then O
a O
questionnaire O
was O
administered O
on O
whether O
they O
burnt O
their O
tongue O
easily O
with O
hot O
food O
and O
whether O
they O
were O
irritated O
by O
certain O

There O
were O
200 O
participants O
aged O
20 O
years O
and O
over O

104 O
( O
52 O
% O
) O
were O
classified O
as O
atopic O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
personal O
history O
. O

There O
was O
a O
significant O
positive O
association O
between O
increasingly O
inflamed O
fungiform O
papillae O
and O
the O
likelihood O
of O
being O
atopic O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
positive O
association O
between O
increasing O
inflammation O
of O
the O
fungiform O
papillae O
and O
a O
history O
of O
both O
burning O
the O
tongue O
easily O
and O
irritation O
of O
the O
tongue O
by O
food O
. O

There O
was O
an O
increased O
likelihood O
of O
a O
history O
of O
irritation O
of O
the O
tongue O
with O
certain O
foods O
amongst O
atopic O
participants O
and O
they O
were O
also O
more O
likely O
to O
burn O
their O
tongue O
with O
hot O
food O
than O
those O
who O
were O
nonatopic O
. O

Atopic O
people O
are O
more O
likely O
than O
the O
normal O
community O
to O
have O
inflammation O
of O
the O
fungiform O
papillae O
of O
their O
tongue O
which O
correlates O
with O
a O
history O
of O
a O
sensitive O
tongue O
manifest O
as O
irritation O
by O

These O
data O
suggest O
that O
atopic O

Chronic O
granulomatous O
disease O
is O
an O
extremely O
rare O
primary O
immunodeficiency O
syndrome O
that O
can O
be O
associated O
with O
various O
oral O
complications O
. O

This O
can O
affect O
high O
number O
of O
patients O
. O

However O
, O
data O
on O
oral O
complications O
is O
sparse O
. O

Here O
we O
will O
review O
the O
literature O
and O
describe O
the O
orofacial O
findings O
in O
12 O
patients O
. O

The O
age O
range O
was O
5 O
- O
31 O
years O
. O

Oral O
findings O
were O
variable O
, O
and O
reflected O
a O
low O
level O
of O
oral O
hygiene O
. O

They O
included O
periodontitis O
, O
rampant O
caries O
, O
gingivitis O
, O
aphthous O
- O
like O
ulcers O
, O
and O
geographic O

. O

One O
patient O
had O
white O
patches O
on O
the O
buccal O
mucosa O
similar O
to O
lichen O
planus O
. O

Another O
patient O
had O
a O
nodular O
dorsum O
of O
the O
tongue O
associated O
with O
fissured O
and O
geographic O
tongue O
. O

Biopsies O
from O
the O
latter O
two O
lesions O
revealed O
chronic O
non O

specific O
mucositis O
. O

Panoramic O
radiographs O
showed O
extensive O
periodontitis O
in O
one O
patient O
and O
periapical O
lesions O
in O
another O
patient O
. O

Patients O
with O
chronic O
granulomatous O
disease O
may O
develop O
oral O
lesions O
reflecting O
susceptibility O
to O
infections O
and O
inflammation O
. O

It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
social O
and O
genetic O
factors O
may O
influence O
the O
development O
of O
this O
complication O
. O

Therefore O
, O
oral O
hygiene O
must O
be O
kept O
at O
an O
optimum O
level O
to O
prevent O
infections O
that O
can O
be O

Geographic O
tongue O
, O
also O
called O
benign O

glossitis O
, O
is O
a O
common O
and O
superficial O
benign O
inflammatory O
disorder O
that O
affects O
the O
tongue O
epithelium O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
geographic O
tongue O
lesions O
typically O
manifest O
as O
irregular O
central O
erythematous O
patches O
. O

These O
lesions O
, O
which O
are O
caused O
by O
the O
loss O
of O
filiform O
papillae O
, O
are O
defined O
by O
an O

This O
may O
represent O
the O
first O

Even O
if O
the O
existence O
of O

has O
been O
suggested O
, O
it O
is O
still O
a O
debated O
issue O
. O

Indeed O
, O
oral O
inflammatory O
diseases O
may O
histologically O
resemble O
psoriasis O

. O

However O
, O
an O
increased O
prevalence O
of O
fissured O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
psoriatic O
patients O
, O
being O
a O
transitory O
and O
permanent O
lesion O
, O
respectively O
. O

Recently O
, O
it O
was O
hypothesized O
that O
gingivitis O
and O
periodontitis O
share O
the O
same O
underlying O
inflammatory O
pathogenetic O
process O
of O
psoriasis O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
, O
psoriatic O
patients O
were O
investigated O
for O
oral O
mucosa O
lesions O
prevalence O
as O
well O
as O
gum O

. O

Results O
displayed O
an O
increased O
association O
between O
gingivitis O
/ O
periodontitis O
and O
psoriasis O
, O
which O
may O
suggest O
common O
underlying O
pathogenic O
risk O
factors O
. O

However O
, O
large O

scale O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
evaluate O
the O
real O
prevalence O
of O
gingivitis O
and O
periodontitis O
in O
these O
patients O
, O
to O
consider O
them O

Some O
oral O

have O
been O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O

disease O
2019 O
( O
COVID O

) O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
question O
about O
whether O
these O
lesions O
are O
due O
to O
coronavirus O
infection O
or O
secondary O
manifestations O
resulting O
from O
the O
patient O

Thus O
, O
this O

aims O
to O
report O
an O
additional O

such O
as O
recurrent O

, O
and O
geographic O

We O
support O
the O
argument O
that O
some O
oral O
conditions O
could O
be O
secondary O
to O
the O
deterioration O
of O
systemic O
health O
or O
due O
to O
treatments O
for O

The O
correlation O
between O

is O
not O

few O
studies O
have O
investigated O
the O

Due O

it O
is O
no O

A O

The O
results O
showed O
that O
the O

are O
similar O
in O
the O
tumoral O
