The O
endemic O
treponematoses O
which O
comprise O
yaws O
, O
endemic O
syphilis O
( O
bejel O
) O
and O
pinta O
constitute O
a O
group O
of O
potentially O
disabling O
and O
disfiguring O
infections O
which O
primarily O
afflict O
children O
in O
tropical O
and O
subtropical O
areas O
. O

Foci O
where O
these O
diseases O
are O
now O
endemic O
have O
a O
patchy O
distribution O
and O
are O
typically O
confined O
to O
underprivileged O
communities O
living O
in O
remote O
rural O
areas O

with O
little O
or O
no O
access O
to O
health O
services O
and O
removed O
from O
the O
mainstream O
of O
socioeconomic O
development O
. O

A O
drastic O
decline O
in O
the O
prevalence O
of O
these O
infections O
was O
brought O
about O
by O
the O
implementation O
of O
mass O

campaigns O
with O

under O
the O
technical O
guidance O
of O

and O
with O

These O
worldwide O
campaigns O
against O
the O
endemic O
treponematoses O
halted O
disease O
transmission O
in O
many O
areas O
and O
held O
the O
promise O
of O
complete O
eradication O
if O
intensive O
surveillance O
could O
be O
continued O
for O
some O
time O
with O
the O
increasing O
involvement O
of O
the O
basic O
health O

. O

National O
campaigns O
were O
so O
successful O
that O
relatively O
low O
priority O
was O
given O
to O
the O
preparation O
of O
the O
rural O
health O
services O
for O
this O
new O
task O
. O

The O
failure O
of O
many O
countries O
to O
integrate O
active O
control O
measures O
into O
the O
functions O
of O
the O
rural O
health O
services O
led O
to O
the O
gradual O
build O

of O

and O
the O
resurgence O
of O

particularly O
in O

where O
standards O
of O

In O

; O
in O

Evidence O
- O

allows O
clear O
separation O
of O

from O
other O
diseases O
in O
its O
class O
of O

transcending O
the O
limitations O
of O

These O
insights O

of O
any O

the O
time O

Columbus O
excludes O
it O
as O
site O
of O
origin O
of O

. O

Treponemal O
disease O
appears O
to O
have O
originated O
in O
East O
Africa O
with O
late O
transmission O
to O
England O
, O
perhaps O
as O
a O
complication O
of O
the O
slave O
trade O
. O

The O
original O
treponemal O
disease O
apparently O
spread O
from O
Africa O
through O
Asia O
, O
entering O
North O
America O
. O

Approximately O
8 O

, O
it O
mutated O

A O
form O
of O

exists O
in O
the O
Bakwena O
Reserve O
of O
the O
Bechuanaland O
Protectorate O
known O
by O
the O
local O

of O
" O

It O
is O
similar O
to O
bejel O
, O
njovera O
and O
the O
endemic O
syphilis O
reported O
elsewhere O
in O
the O
world O
. O

The O
Government O
of O
the O
Protectorate O
, O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
WHO O
and O
UNICEF O
, O
began O
in O
November O
1953 O
a O
mass O
campaign O
in O
the O
Reserve O
to O
control O
this O
disease O
and O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
to O
study O
its O
epidemiological O
, O
clinical O
, O
social O
and O
therapeutic O
aspects O
. O

The O
seropositivity O
rate O
in O
the O
Reserve O
was O
found O
to O
be O
37 O
% O
. O
Dichuchwa O
is O
a O
childhood O
and O
family O
disease O
, O
usually O
spread O
non O

venereally O
. O

The O
early O
lesions O
are O
similar O
to O
secondary O
lesions O
of O
sporadic O
venereal O
syphilis O
, O
and O
are O
often O
followed O
by O
tertiary O
lesions O
affecting O
mainly O
the O
skin O
, O
nasopharynx O
and O
long O
bones O
. O

Primary O
lesions O
are O
rare O
but O
may O
occur O
under O
certain O
epidemiological O
conditions O
if O
the O
inoculum O
is O
sufficiently O
large O
; O
thus O
a O
mother O
may O
develop O
primary O
sores O
on O
the O
nipples O
through O
suckling O
an O
infected O
infant O
. O

Lesions O
of O
the O
cardiovascular O
and O
central O
nervous O
systems O
and O
congenital O
syphilis O
are O
also O
rare O
. O

Superinfection O
of O
an O
already O
infected O
and O
allergic O
host O
is O
probably O
the O
chief O
reason O
for O
the O
frequency O
of O
the O
tertiary O
lesions O
. O
Treatment O
of O
the O
disease O
with O
penicillin O
is O
very O
effective O

and O
the O

that O
mass O
treatment O
of O
cases O
and O
contacts O
combined O
with O
an O
improvement O
in O
the O
standards O
of O
hygiene O
could O
eradicate O
the O
disease O

and O
the O

has O
evolved O
under O
strong O

In O
this O

we O
investigated O
ten O

using O
a O
combination O
of O
macroscopic O
observation O

in O

to O
determine O
whether O
the O

, O
we O
obtained O

using O

collected O
from O

We O
report O
that O

were O
present O
at O
four O

the O

examined O
, O
and O

was O
used O
to O
confirm O

By O

, O
no O

observed O
at O

2006 O

indicated O
that O

ten O

lesions O
severe O
enough O
to O
cause O
major O

Finally O
, O
we O
found O
that O
T O
. O
pallidum O
strains O
from O
Lake O
Manyara O
National O
Park O
and O
Serengeti O
National O
Park O
were O
genetically O
distinct O
, O
and O
a O
phylogeny O
suggested O
that O
baboon O
strains O
may O
have O
diverged O
prior O
to O
the O
clade O
containing O
human O
strains O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
T O
. O
pallidum O
infection O
associated O
with O
genital O
lesions O
appears O
to O
be O
common O
in O
the O
wild O

A O

About O
Treponema O

. O

There O
is O
not O
a O
time O
in O
the O
history O
when O
epidemics O
did O
not O
loom O
large O
: O
infectious O
diseases O
have O
always O
had O
civilisation O
and O
evolution O
- O
altering O
consequences O
. O

Throughout O
history O
, O
there O
have O
been O
a O
number O
of O
pandemics O
: O
cholera O
, O
bubonic O
plague O
, O
influenza O
, O
smallpox O
are O
some O
of O
the O
most O
brutal O
killers O
in O
human O
history O
. O

Historical O
accounts O
of O
pandemics O
clearly O
demonstrate O
that O
war O
, O
unhygienic O
conditions O
, O
social O
and O
health O
inequality O
create O
conditions O
for O
the O
transmission O
of O
infectious O
diseases O
, O
and O
existing O
health O
disparities O
can O
contribute O
to O
unequal O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
. O

The O
Renaissance O
was O
a O
period O
of O
European O
cultural O
, O
artistic O
, O
political O
and O
economic O
" O
rebirth O
" O
following O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
, O
but O
it O
was O
also O
the O
time O
when O
new O
infectious O
disease O
appeared O
, O
such O
as O
Syphilis O
. O

The O
epidemic O
spread O
of O
Syphilis O
began O
between O
the O
late O
15th O
century O
and O
early O
16th O
century O
due O
to O
the O
increased O
migration O
of O
peoples O
across O
Europe O
. O

The O
rapid O
spread O
of O
venereal O
syphilis O
throughout O
Europe O
suggests O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O
disease O
into O
a O
population O
that O
had O
not O
previously O
been O
exposed O
. O

Syphilis O
is O
a O
type O
of O
treponematosis O
, O
which O
includes O
syphilis O
, O
bejel O
, O
yaws O
, O
and O
pinta O
, O
but O
, O
while O
syphilis O
is O
venereal O
disease O
, O
the O
others O
are O
nonvenereal O
. O

Syphilis O
was O
, O
at O
the O
beginning O
, O
a O
disease O
of O
great O
severity O
due O
to O
its O
novelty O
, O
as O
the O
population O
had O
no O
time O
to O
gain O
any O
immunity O
against O
this O
venereal O
disease O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
is O
to O
investigate O
the O
origin O
of O
syphilis O
and O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
treatments O
from O
the O
empiric O
means O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
penicillin O
, O
but O
also O
to O
understand O
how O
this O
venereal O
disease O
has O
largely O
influenced O
human O
lifestyle O
and O
evolution O
. O

The O
first O
of O
the O
three O
hypotheses O
about O
its O
origins O
is O
the O
Columbian O
hypothesis O
, O
which O
states O
that O
Columbus O
' O
s O
crew O
acquired O
syphilis O
from O
Native O
Americans O
and O
carried O
it O
back O
to O
Europe O
in O
1493 O
A O
. O

D O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
second O
hypothesis O
( O
pre O
- O
Columbian O
) O
asserts O
that O
syphilis O
was O
present O
in O
Europe O
long O
before O
Columbus O
' O
s O
voyage O
and O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
New O
World O
by O
Columbus O
' O
s O
men O
. O

The O
Unitarian O
theory O
argues O
that O
syphilis O
, O
bejel O
, O
yaws O
, O
and O
pinta O
are O
not O
separate O
diseases O
but O
they O
represent O
syndromes O
caused O
by O
slightly O
different O
strains O
of O
one O
organism O
. O

Nowadays O
, O
Syphilis O
' O
origin O
is O
still O
uncertain O
and O
remains O
controversial O
. O

However O
, O
the O
large O
impact O
on O
the O
social O
behavior O
and O
international O
public O
health O
is O
an O
important O
reason O
to O
investigate O
about O
its O
origins O
and O
how O
to O
prevent O
the O
transmission O

The O
partial O
orthopedic O
reconstruction O
of O
the O
knee O
joint O
with O
an O
osteochondral O
allograft O
requires O
precise O
planning O
based O
on O
medical O
imaging O
reliant O
; O
an O
artificial O
intelligence O
capable O
of O
determining O
the O
morphology O
of O
the O
cartilage O
tissue O
can O
be O
of O
great O
help O
in O
such O
a O
planning O
. O

We O
aimed O
to O
develop O
and O
train O
an O
artificial O
intelligence O
capable O
of O
determining O
the O
cartilage O
morphology O
in O
a O
knee O
joint O
based O
on O
an O
MR O
image O
. O

After O
having O
determined O
the O
most O
appropriate O
MR O
sequence O
to O
use O
for O
this O
project O
and O
having O
acquired O
180 O
knee O
MR O
images O
, O
we O
created O
the O
training O
set O
for O
the O
artificial O
intelligence O
by O
manually O
and O
semi O
- O
automatically O
segmenting O
the O
contours O
of O
the O
cartilage O
in O
the O
images O
. O

We O
then O
trained O
the O
neural O
network O
with O
this O
dataset O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
our O
work O
, O
the O
artificial O
intelligence O
is O
capable O
to O
determine O
the O
morphology O
of O
the O
cartilage O
tissue O
in O
the O
MR O
image O
to O
a O
level O
of O
accuracy O
that O
is O
sufficient O
for O
surgery O

, O
therefore O
we O
have O
made O
the O
