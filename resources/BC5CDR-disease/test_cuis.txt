have -
shown -
the -

The -

is -
severely -
impaired -
. -

We -
recently -
reported -
in -
young -
healthy -
subjects -
that -
inhibitory -
cerebellar -
stimulation -
enhanced -
the -
sensorimotor -
plasticity -
of -
M1 -
that -
was -
induced -
by -
paired -
associative -
stimulation -
( -
PAS -
) -
. -

This -
study -
demonstrates -
that -
the -
deficient -
sensorimotor -
M1 -
plasticity -
in -
16 -
patients -
with -
LIDs D004409
could -
be -
reinstated -
by -
a -
single -
session -
of -
real -
inhibitory -
cerebellar -
stimulation -
but -
not -
sham -
stimulation -
. -

This -
was -
evident -
only -
when -
a -
sensory -
component -
was -
involved -
in -
the -
induction -
of -
plasticity -
, -
indicating -
that -
cerebellar -
sensory -
processing -
function -
is -
involved -
in -
the -
resurgence -
of -
M1 -
plasticity -
. -

The -
benefit -
of -
inhibitory -
cerebellar -
stimulation -
on -
LIDs D004409
is -
known -
. -

To -
explore -
whether -
this -
benefit -
is -
linked -
to -
the -
restoration -
of -
sensorimotor -
plasticity -
of -
M1 -
, -
we -
conducted -
an -
additional -
study -
looking -
at -
changes -
in -
LIDs D004409
and -
PAS -
- -
induced -
plasticity -
after -
10 -
sessions -
of -
either -
bilateral -
, -
real -
inhibitory -
cerebellar -
stimulation -
or -
sham -
stimulation -
. -

Only -
real -
and -
not -
sham -
stimulation -
had -
an -
antidyskinetic -
effect -
and -
it -
was -
paralleled -
by -
a -
resurgence -
in -
the -
sensorimotor -
plasticity -
of -
M1 -
. -

These -
results -
suggest -
that -
alterations -
in -
cerebellar -
sensory -
processing -
function -
, -
occurring -
secondary -
to -
abnormal -
basal -

reaching -
it -

CONCLUSION -
: -
In -
this -
study -
early -
postoperative D011183
delirium -
was -
found -
to -
be -
a -
very -
common -
complication -
after -
major -
surgery -
, -
even -
in -
a -
population -
without -
known -
risk -
factors -
. -

Thiopentone -
was -
independently -
associated -
with -
an -
increase -
in -
its -
relative -
risk -
. -

A -
single -
neurotoxic D020258
dose -
of -
methamphetamine -
induces -
a -
long -
- -
lasting -
depressive D003866
- -
like -
behaviour -
in -
mice -
. -

Methamphetamine -
( -
METH -
) -
triggers -
a -
disruption -
of -
the -
monoaminergic -
system -
and -
METH -
abuse -
leads -
to -
negative -
emotional -
states -
including -
depressive D003866
symptoms -
during -
drug -
withdrawal -
. -

However -
, -
it -
is -
currently -
unknown -
if -
the -
acute -
toxic -
dosage -
of -
METH -
also -
causes -
a -
long -
- -
lasting -
depressive D003866
phenotype -
and -
persistent -
monoaminergic -
deficits -
. -

Thus -
, -
we -
now -
assessed -
the -
depressive D003866
- -
like -
behaviour -
in -
mice -
at -
early -
and -
long -
- -

periods -

dose -
( -
30 -

) -
. -

METH -
did -
not -
alter -
the -
motor -
function -

of -
mice -
as -
assessed -

platform -
in -
a -

However -
, -
METH -
significantly -
increased -
the -
immobility -

in -
the -
tail -

test -
at -
3 -
and -
49 -
days -
post -
- -
administration -
. -

This -
depressive D003866
- -
like -
profile -
induced -
by -
METH -
was -
accompanied -
by -
a -
marked -
depletion -
of -
frontostriatal -
dopaminergic -

serotonergic -
neurotransmission -
, -
indicated -
by -
a -
reduction -
in -

observed -
at -
both -
3 -
and -
49 -
days -
post -
- -

These -

demonstrate -
for -
the -

that -
a -

INTRODUCTION -
: -
Diazinon -
Yis -
one -
of -
the -
most -
broadly -
used -
organophosphorus -
insecticides -
in -
agriculture -
. -

It -
has -
been -
shown -
that -
exposure -
to -
diazinon -
may -
interfere -
with -
lipid -
metabolism -
. -

Moreover -
, -
the -
hypolipidemic -
effect -
of -
crocin -
has -
been -
established -
. -

Earlier -
studies -
revealed -
the -
major -
role -
of -
Extracellular -

( -
ERK -
) -
pathways -
in -

( -
LDLr -
) -
expression -
. -

The -
aim -
of -
this -
study -
was -
to -
evaluate -
changes -
in -
the -
regulation -
of -
lipid -
metabolism -
, -
ERK -
and -
LDLr -
expression -
in -
the -
liver -
of -
rats -
exposed -
to -

. -

Furthermore -
ameliorating -

METHODS -
: -

) -
. -

The -
levels -
of -
cholesterol -
, -
triglyceride -
and -
LDL -
in -

were -
analyzed -
. -

Moreover -

as -
protein -
levels -
of -
total -

were -
evaluated -
by -
Western -

and -
quantitative -

analysis -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Our -
data -
showed -
that -
subacute -
exposure -
to -
diazinon -
significantly -
increased -
concentrations -
of -
cholesterol -
, -
triglyceride -
and -
LDL -
. -

Moreover -
diazinon -
decreased -
ERK1 -

protein -
phosphorylation -
and -
LDLr -
transcript -
. -

Crocin -
reduced -
inhibition -
of -
ERK -
activation -
and -
diazinon -
- -
induced -
hyperlipemia D006949
and -
increased -
levels -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Crocin -
may -
be -
considered -
as -
a -
novel -
protective -
agent -
in -
diazinon -

DISCUSSION -
: -
SIADH D007177
has -
been -
widely -
reported -
with -
a -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Clinicians -
should -
be -
aware -
of -
the -
potential -
for -
antidepressants -
to -
cause -

drugs -
, -
recent -
cases -

A -
52 -
- -
year -
- -
old -
Chinese -
man -
reported -
with -
liver D056486
damage -
, -
which -
appeared -
12 -
hours -
after -
beginning -
treatment -
with -
fluvastatin -
. -

Patient -
presented -
with -
complaints -
of -
increasing -
nausea D009325
, -
anorexia D000855
, -
and -
upper -
abdominal D015746

. -

His -
laboratory -
values -
showed -
elevated -
creatine -
kinase -
and -
transaminases -
. -

Testing -
for -
autoantibodies -
was -
also -
negative -
. -

The -
liver -
biochemistries -
eventually -
normalized -
within -
3 -
weeks -
of -
stopping -
the -
fluvastatin -
. -

Therefore -
, -
when -
prescribing -
statins -
, -
the -
possibility -
of -
hepatic D056486
damage -
should -
be -
taken -
into -

were -
attempted -
, -
but -
the -
procedure -
was -
aborted -
due -
to -

We -
found -
that -

lead -
to -

The -

demonstrated -
that -

The -

of -

revealed -
that -
pro -

was -
upregulated -
, -
and -
anti -

apoptotic -
protein -
BCL -

Hence -
, -
our -

suggest -
that -
aconitine -
significantly -
aggravates -
Ca -

. -

Cisplatin -
treatment -
has -
been -
adopted -
in -
some -
chemotherapies -
; -
however -
, -
this -
drug -
can -
induce -
acute D058186
kidney -

due -
its -
ability -
to -
negatively -
affect -
renal -

The -
kinin -
B2 -

has -
been -
associated -
with -
the -
inflammation D007249
process -
, -
as -
well -
as -
the -

and -
its -

resulted -
in -
an -

To -
examine -
the -
role -
of -
the -
kinin -
B2 -
receptor -
in -
cisplatin -
- -
induced -
acute D058186
kidney -

, -
kinin -

knockout -
mice -
were -

Additionally -
, -
WT -
mice -
were -
treated -
with -
a -
B2 -

antagonist -
after -
cisplatin -
administration -
. -

B2 -
receptor -
- -
deficient -
mice -
were -
less -
sensitive -
to -
this -
drug -
than -
the -
WT -
mice -
, -
as -

Moreover -
, -
treatment -
with -
the -
kinin -
B2 -
receptor -
antagonist -
effectively -
reduced -
the -
levels -
of -
serum -
creatinine -
and -
blood -
urea -
after -
cisplatin -
administration -
. -

Thus -
, -
our -
data -
suggest -
that -
the -
kinin -
B2 -
receptor -
is -
involved -
in -
cisplatin -
- -
induced -
acute D058186
kidney -
injury -
by -
mediating -
the -
necrotic D009336

and -
the -

, -
thus -
resulting -
in -

UNASSIGNED -
: -
Our -

indicated -
that -

could -
induce -

Recent -
research -
suggested -
that -
IUGR D005317
is -
a -
risk -

However -
, -
whether -

This -

The -
results -
revealed -
that -

have -
much -
in -

anatomically -

with -
the -

The -

myodystrophy D009136
in -
the -

by -
giving -
it -

The -
pharmacological -

and -
the -
degenerative -
changes -
brought -
about -
by -
its -
deficiency -
, -
especially -
in -
the -
muscles -
, -
are -
illustrated -

It -
is -
thus -
confirmed -
that -
the -
histological -
characteristics -
of -
myopathic D009135
rat -
muscle -
induced -
experimentally -
are -
extraordinarily -
similar -
to -
those -

as -
confirmed -
during -

performed -
at -

The -
encouraging -
results -
obtained -
in -
various -
authoratative -
departments -
in -
myopathic D009135
patients -
by -
using -

have -
encouraged -
the -

to -

the -
beneficial -

of -
one -

, -
but -
most -
of -
all -
they -
found -
histological -
changes -
due -
to -
" -

changes -
in -
the -
muscle -

which -
however -
maintained -
its -

characteristics -
in -
the -
control -
animals -
that -
were -
not -
treated -
with -
the -
anabolizing -

The -
authors -
conclude -
by -
affirming -
the -
undoubted -
efficacy -
of -
the -
anabolizing -
steroids -
in -
experimental -
myopathic D009135
disease -
, -
but -
they -
have -
reservations -
as -
to -
the -
transfer -
of -
the -
results -
into -
the -
human -
field -
, -
where -
high -
dosage -
cannot -
be -
carried -
out -
continuously -
because -
of -
the -
effects -
of -
the -
drug -
on -

because -
the -

- -
a -
- -
vis -
the -

of -

and -
finally -
because -
the -
dystrophic -

agent -
is -

the -

something -

None -

The -
aim -
of -
the -

was -
to -
conduct -
the -
first -
investigation -

: -
There -
were -
no -

The -
selective -
deficit D001925
in -

manifested -
by -
the -
RC -

cannot -
be -
explained -
by -
the -
subacute -

The -

were -
also -
performed -

It -
was -
found -
that -
three -

failed -
to -
affect -
the -

catalepsy D002375
was -
increased -
by -
clonidine -
and -
decreased -
by -
naphazoline -
and -

. -

The -
brain -
concentration -
of -
NA -
was -
not -
changed -
by -
morphine -

, -
but -
one -
of -
the -
doses -
of -
codeine -
( -
45 -

slightly -
enhanced -
it -
. -

Pentazocine -
dose -
- -
dependently -
decreased -
the -
brain -
level -
of -
NA -
. -

The -
rate -
of -
NA -
turnover -
was -
not -
altered -
by -
analgesics -
except -
for -
the -
higher -
dose -
of -
fentanyl -
( -

2 -
mg -

following -

are -

in -
the -
light -
of -
various -
and -

data -
from -
the -
literature -

It -
is -
suggested -
that -
in -

the -

NA -
plays -
a -
less -
important -
function -
than -
the -

monoamines -

Asterixis D020820

There -

reports -
about -
asterixis D020820
as -
a -
side -
effect -
of -

with -
psychopharmacologic -
agents -

In -
this -
report -
we -
present -
four -
patients -
treated -
with -
a -
combination -
of -
different -
psychotropic -
drugs -
, -
in -
whom -
asterixis D020820
was -
triggered -
either -
by -
adding -
carbamazepine -
( -
CBZ -
) -
to -
a -
treatment -
regimen -

or -
by -

its -
dosage -

Neither -

We -
consider -
asterixis D020820
to -
be -
an -
easily -
overlooked -
sign -
of -
neurotoxicity D020258
, -
which -
may -
occur -
even -
at -
low -

Pharmacodynamics -

were -
examined -
in -
parkinsonian D010300
patients -
with -
stable -
and -
fluctuating -
responses -
to -
levodopa -
. -

The -
magnitude -
of -
the -
hypotensive D007022
effect -
of -
levodopa -
was -
concentration -
dependent -
and -
was -
fit -
to -
an -
Emax -
model -
in -
fluctuating -
responders -
. -

Stable -
responders -
demonstrated -
a -
small -
hypotensive D007022
response -
. -

Baseline -
blood -
pressures -
were -
higher -
in -
fluctuating -
patients -
; -
a -

baseline -
blood -

correlated -
with -

Phenylalanine -

with -

barrier -
, -
reduced -
the -
hypotensive D007022

We -
conclude -
that -
levodopa -
has -
a -
central -
hypotensive D007022
action -
that -
parallels -
the -
motor -
effects -
in -

The -
view -
against -

Despite -
extensive -
clinical -
experience -
the -
role -
of -
digoxin -
is -
still -
not -
well -
defined -
. -

In -
patients -
with -

For -
patients -
in -

failure -
the -
situation -
is -
less -
clear -

Digoxin -
has -
a -
narrow -
therapeutic -
: -
toxic -
ratio -
and -
concentrations -
are -
affected -
by -
a -
number -
of -
drugs -

Also -
, -
digoxin -
has -
undesirable -
effects -
such -
as -
increasing -
peripheral -
resistance -
and -
myocardial -
demands -

and -
causing -
arrhythmias D001145

There -
is -
a -
paucity -

The -
trials -
that -
are -
available -
are -
generally -
small -
with -
limitations -
in -
design -
and -
these -
show -
variation -
in -
patient -
benefit -

More -
convincing -
evidence -
is -
required -
showing -
that -
digoxin -
improves -
symptoms -
or -
exercise -
capacity -

Furthermore -
, -
no -
trial -
has -
had -
sufficient -
power -
to -
evaluate -
mortality -

Pooled -
analysis -
of -
the -
effects -
of -

inotropic -
drugs -
shows -
an -
excess -

there -
is -

possibility -
that -
digoxin -
may -
increase -

within -

The -
pathophysiology -
underlying -
this -
acute -
hepatic D056486
injury -
is -
unknown -
. -

This -
study -
was -
undertaken -
to -
determine -
whether -
oxidants -
are -
associated -
with -
the -
hepatic D056486
injury -
and -
to -
determine -
the -
relative -
value -
of -
several -
indirect -
methods -
of -
assessing -
oxidant -
exposure -
in -
vivo -
. -

Rats -
were -
subjected -
to -
a -
standardized -
intestinal -
ischemia D007511
- -
reperfusion D015427
injury -
. -

Hepatic -
tissue -
was -
assayed -
for -
lipid -
peroxidation -
products -
and -
oxidized -
and -
reduced -
glutathione -
. -

There -
was -
no -
change -
in -
hepatic -
tissue -
total -
glutathione -
following -
intestinal -
ischemia D007511
- -
reperfusion D015427
injury -
. -

Oxidized -
glutathione -
( -
GSSG -
) -
increased -
significantly -
following -
30 -
and -
60 -
min -
of -
reperfusion -
. -

There -
was -
no -
increase -
in -
any -
of -
the -
products -
of -
lipid -
peroxidation -
associated -
with -
this -
injury -
. -

An -
increase -
in -
GSSG -
within -
hepatic -
tissue -
during -
intestinal -
reperfusion -
suggests -
exposure -
of -
hepatocytes -
to -
an -
oxidant -
stress -
. -

The -
lack -
of -
a -
significant -
increase -
in -
products -
of -
lipid -
peroxidation -
suggests -
that -
the -
oxidant -
stress -
is -
of -
insufficient -
magnitude -
to -
result -
in -
irreversible -
injury -
to -
hepatocyte -
cell -
membranes -
. -

These -
data -
also -
suggest -
that -
the -
measurement -
of -
tissue -
GSSG -
may -
be -
a -
more -
sensitive -
indicator -
of -
oxidant -
stress -
than -
measurement -
of -
products -
of -
lipid -
peroxidation -

Diphenhydramine -
prevents -
the -
haemodynamic -
changes -
of -
cimetidine -
in -
ICU -
patients -
. -

Cimetidine -
, -
a -
histamine -
2 -
( -
H2 -
) -
antagonist -
, -
produces -
a -
decrease -
in -
arterial -
pressure -
due -
to -
vasodilatation -
, -
especially -
in -
critically -
ill -
patients -
. -

This -
may -
be -
because -
cimetidine -
acts -
as -
a -
histamine -
agonist -
. -

We -
, -
therefore -
, -
investigated -
the -
effects -
of -
the -
histamine -
1 -
( -
H1 -
) -
receptor -
antagonist -
, -
diphenhydramine -
, -
on -
the -
haemodynamic -
changes -
observed -
after -
cimetidine -
in -
ICU -
patients -
. -

Each -
patient -
was -
studied -
on -
two -
separate -
days -
. -

In -
a -
random -
fashion -
, -
they -
received -
cimetidine -
200 -
mg -

on -
one -
day -
, -
and -
on -
the -
other -
, -
a -
pretreatment -
of -
diphenhydramine -
40 -

with -

200 -

. -

In -
the -
non -

pretreatment -
group -
, -
mean -
arterial -

decreased -
from -

Also -

. -

In -
contrast -
, -
in -
the -

We -
conclude -
that -
an -
H1 -
antagonist -
may -
be -
useful -
in -
preventing -
hypotension D007022
caused -
by -
iv -

Cromakalim -
was -
approximately -

fold -
more -
potent -
than -

Vasodilation -
of -

When -

Thus -
, -
whereas -

- -
independently -
dilates -
large -
coronary -

, -
cromakalim -

Three -
major -
results -
are -
reported -

First -
, -
pretreatment -
with -
MK -
- -

produced -
an -
effective -
and -
dose -
- -

anticonvulsant -
action -
with -
the -
lithium -
- -
pilocarpine -
model -
but -
not -
with -
rats -
treated -
with -
pilocarpine -
alone -
, -
suggesting -
that -
different -
biochemical -
mechanisms -
control -
seizures D012640
in -
these -
two -
models -
. -

Second -
, -
the -
anticonvulsant -
effect -
of -
MK -
- -
801 -
in -
the -
lithium -
- -
pilocarpine -
model -
only -
occurred -
after -
initial -
periods -
of -
seizure D012640
activity -
. -

This -
observation -
is -
suggested -
to -
be -
an -
in -
vivo -
demonstration -
of -
the -
conclusion -
derived -
from -
in -
vitro -
experiments -
that -
MK -
- -
801 -
binding -
requires -
agonist -
- -
induced -
opening -
of -
the -
channel -
sites -
of -
the -
NMDA -
receptor -
. -

Third -
, -
although -
it -
is -
relatively -
easy -
to -
block -
seizures D012640
induced -
by -
lithium -
and -
pilocarpine -
by -
administration -
of -
anticonvulsants -
prior -
to -
pilocarpine -
, -
it -
is -
more -
difficult -
to -
terminate -
ongoing -
status D013226
epilepticus -
and -
block -
the -
lethality -
of -
the -
seizures D012640
. -

Administration -
of -
MK -
- -
801 -
30 -
or -
60 -
min -
after -
pilocarpine -
, -
i -
. -
e -
. -
, -
during -
status D013226
epilepticus -
, -
gradually -
reduced -
electrical -
and -
behavioral -
seizure D012640
activity -
and -
greatly -
enhanced -
the -
survival -
rate -
. -

These -
results -
suggest -
that -
activation -
of -
NMDA -
receptors -
plays -
an -
important -
role -
in -
status D013226
epilepticus -
and -
brain D001930
damage -
in -
the -
lithium -
- -
pilocarpine -
model -
. -

This -
was -
further -
supported -
by -
results -
showing -
that -
nonconvulsive -
doses -
of -
NMDA -
and -
pilocarpine -
were -
synergistic -
, -
resulting -
in -
status D013226
epilepticus -
and -
subsequent -
mortality -

during -
which -
he -
was -

at -
a -

This -
is -
inconsistent -
with -
the -
well -
- -
established -
finding -
that -

However -
, -

Haloperidol -

did -
lower -

the -

The -

was -
to -
determine -
whether -
the -
neurotoxicity D020258

is -
altered -
in -

onset -
of -

which -
occurred -
after -
28 -

30 -
minutes -

Theophylline -
concentrations -
at -
this -
endpoint -
in -
serum -
( -

were -
similar -
but -
serum -
( -

and -
brain -
concentrations -
were -
slightly -
different -
in -

Theophylline -
serum -
protein -

Fetal -
serum -
concentrations -
at -
onset -
of -

mother -
were -
similar -
to -
maternal -

CSF -
concentrations -
and -
correlated -
significantly -
with -
the -

It -
is -
concluded -
that -

Intramedullary -
administration -

in -
both -
the -

. -

The -

On -
the -

hand -
, -
the -

bradycardia D001919
was -
antagonized -
by -
prior -

Furthermore -
, -
selective -

The -

The -

brought -
about -
by -
a -
decrease -
in -
sympathetic -

the -

control -
a -

It -
was -

that -
this -

s -
tumor D009369

recurring -
at -
the -

Since -
she -

none -
following -
discontinuation -
of -
the -
Imipramine -
( -
when -
she -
was -
in -
florid -
relapse -
) -
, -
we -
believe -
that -
this -
drug -
rather -
than -
her -
underlying -
disease -
alone -
caused -
her -
hypertension D006973

The -
mechanism -
for -
this -

is -
believed -
to -
be -
increased -
levels -
of -

catecholamines -
due -
to -
interference -
of -
their -

Experiments -
in -
mice -
tested -
previous -
evidence -
that -
activation -
of -
cholinergic -
systems -
promotes -
catalepsy D002375
and -
that -
cholinergic -
mechanisms -
need -
to -
be -
intact -
for -
full -
expression -
of -
neuroleptic -
- -
induced -
catalepsy D002375

Large -
doses -
of -
the -
cholinomimetic -
, -
pilocarpine -
, -
could -
induce -
catalepsy D002375
when -
peripheral -
cholinergic -
receptors -
were -
blocked -
. -

Low -
doses -
of -
pilocarpine -
caused -
a -
pronounced -
enhancement -
of -
the -
catalepsy D002375
that -
was -
induced -
by -
the -
dopaminergic -
blocker -

prevented -
the -

the -
hypothesis -

actually -

The -
most -

aspect -

was -
a -

hypersensitivity D004342

Under -

The -
lack -
of -

revealed -
that -
the -
cardiovascular -
actions -

rats -
were -
linked -
specifically -
to -

Other -
myocardial -

metabolic -
changes -
induced -

The -
contractile -

Similarly -
, -
significant -

in -
myocardial -
energy -

were -
detected -
in -
the -
barium -
- -
exposed -
rats -
which -
were -
consistent -
with -
the -
reduced -
contractile -
element -
shortening -
velocity -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
the -
excitability -
of -
the -
cardiac -

was -
depressed -
preferentially -
in -
the -
atrioventricular -

Overall -

the -
altered -

the -
myocardial -

disturbances -
, -
and -
the -
hypersensitivity D004342
of -
the -

We -
conclude -
that -
PPA -
increases -
blood -
pressure -
by -
increasing -
systemic -
vascular -
resistance -
and -
cardiac -
output -
, -
and -
that -
propranolol -
antagonizes -
this -
increase -
by -
reversing -
the -
effect -
of -
PPA -
on -
cardiac -
output -
. -

That -
propranolol -
antagonizes -
the -
pressor -
effect -
of -
PPA -
is -
in -
contrast -
to -
the -
interaction -
in -
which -
propranolol -
enhances -
the -
pressor -
effect -
of -
norepinephrine -
. -

This -
is -
probably -
because -
PPA -
has -
less -
beta -

activity -
than -
does -

Mice -

had -
greater -
alpha -
- -
bungarotoxin -

The -

were -
equally -
affected -
by -
treatment -
with -
dithiothreitol -

Thus -
it -
appears -
that -
the -
difference -
between -
seizure D012640

animals -
may -
be -
due -
to -
a -

Recently -

was -
identified -
as -
a -
metabolite -
of -

The -
purpose -
of -
this -
study -
was -
to -
determine -
if -
PAP -
formation -
is -
a -
requisite -
step -
in -

was -
determined -

BNPP -
( -

manner -
. -

Pretreatment -
of -
animals -
with -
BNPP -
prior -
to -
APAP -
or -
PAP -
administration -
resulted -
in -
marked -
reduction -
of -
APAP -
( -
900 -
mg -
/ -
kg -
) -
nephrotoxicity D007674
but -
not -
PAP -
nephrotoxicity D007674
. -

This -
result -
was -
not -
due -
to -
altered -
disposition -
of -
either -
APAP -
or -
acetylated -
metabolites -
in -
plasma -
or -
renal -
cortical -
and -
hepatic -

Rather -
, -
BNPP -
pretreatment -
reduced -
the -
fraction -
of -
APAP -
excreted -
as -
PAP -
by -
64 -
and -
75 -
% -
after -
APAP -
doses -
of -
750 -
and -
900 -
mg -

BNPP -
did -
not -
alter -
the -
excretion -
of -
APAP -
or -
any -
of -
its -
non -
- -
deacetylated -
metabolites -
nor -
did -
BNPP -
alter -
excretion -

PAP -
or -
its -
metabolites -
after -
PAP -
doses -
of -
150 -
and -
300 -
mg -

. -

Therefore -
, -
the -
BNPP -
- -
induced -
reduction -
in -
APAP -
- -
induced -
nephrotoxicity D007674
appears -
to -
be -
due -
to -
inhibition -
of -
APAP -
deacetylation -
. -

It -
is -
concluded -
that -
PAP -
formation -
, -
in -
vivo -
, -
accounts -
, -
at -
least -
in -
part -

Vasopressin -

The -
role -
of -
vasopressin -
as -
a -
pressor -
agent -
to -
the -
hypertensive D006973
process -
was -
examined -

Vasopressin -
plays -
a -
major -
role -
in -
the -
pathogenesis -
of -
DOCA -
- -
salt -
hypertension D006973
, -
since -
the -
elevation -
of -
blood -
pressure -
was -
not -
substantial -
in -

rats -
with -
lithium -

treated -

has -
antidiuretic -
action -

effect -
failed -
to -
increase -
blood -
pressure -
to -
the -
levels -
observed -
after -
administration -
of -
AVP -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
the -
pressor -
action -
of -
vasopressin -
appears -
to -
be -
important -
in -
the -
development -
of -
this -
model -
of -
hypertension D006973
, -
since -
the -
enhanced -
pressor -
responsiveness -
to -
the -
hormone -
was -
observed -
in -
the -
initial -
stage -
of -
hypertension D006973
. -

Increased -
secretion -
of -
vasopressin -
from -
neurohypophysis -
also -
promotes -
the -
function -
of -
the -
hormone -
as -
a -
pathogenetic -
factor -
in -
hypertension D006973
. -

An -
unproportional -
release -
of -
vasopressin -
compared -
to -
plasma -
osmolality -
may -
be -
induced -
by -
the -
absence -
of -
an -
adjusting -
control -
of -
angiotensin -
II -
forming -
and -
receptor -
binding -
capacity -
for -
sodium -

the -

remains -

A -

who -
was -
concurrently -
being -
treated -
with -
pilocarpine -

, -
developed -
a -
bradycardia D001919

Both -

was -
consistent -

It -
is -

Misoprostol -
( -

has -
been -
shown -
to -
acutely -
counteract -
the -
indomethacin -
- -
induced -
renal D007674
dysfunction -
in -
well -

The -
aim -
of -
this -
study -
was -
to -
determine -
if -
the -
prophylactic -
value -
of -
misoprostol -
was -
dose -
- -
dependent -
. -

Parameters -
of -
renal -
hemodynamics -
and -

were -
assessed -
by -

patients -
before -
and -
after -
an -
oral -
combination -
of -
50 -
mg -
of -
indomethacin -
and -
various -
doses -
of -
misoprostol -
. -

The -
200 -
- -
micrograms -
dose -
was -
able -
to -
totally -
abolish -
the -
deleterious -
renal -
effects -
of -
indomethacin -
, -
whereas -
the -
800 -
- -
micrograms -
dose -
resulted -
in -
significant -
worsening -
of -
renal -
hemodynamics -
and -
sodium -
retention -
. -

These -
changes -
were -
maximal -
in -
the -
hour -
immediately -
after -
medications -
and -
slowly -
returned -
toward -
base -
- -
line -
levels -
thereafter -
. -

These -
results -
suggest -
that -
the -
renal -
protective -
effects -
of -
misoprostol -
is -
dose -
- -
dependent -
. -

However -
, -
until -
this -
apparent -
ability -
of -
200 -
micrograms -
of -
misoprostol -
to -
prevent -
the -
adverse -
effects -
of -
indomethacin -
on -
renal -
function -
is -
confirmed -
with -
chronic -
frequent -
dosing -
, -
it -
would -
be -
prudent -
to -
avoid -

We -
describe -
the -
cardiopulmonary -

efforts -
on -
five -
patients -
who -
presented -
in -
acute -

and -
one -
had -

All -
patients -
were -
continuously -
monitored -
with -

to -
routine -
noninvasive -

An -

All -
patients -
developed -
cardiocirculatory -

within -
the -
first -
48 -
hours -
of -
their -

to -
the -
pediatric -

Right -
ventricular -
pacemaker -
wires -
were -
inserted -
in -
all -
of -
them -
during -
cardiopulmonary -
resuscitation -
( -
CPR -
) -

In -
four -
patients -
, -
cardiac -
pacing -
was -
used -
, -
resulting -
in -
a -
temporary -
captured -
rhythm -
and -
restoration -
of -
their -
cardiac -

These -
patients -
had -
a -

of -
cardiac D006323
arrest -
, -
resulting -
in -
death -
, -
within -
10 -
to -
60 -
minutes -
. -

In -
one -
patient -
, -
cardiac -
pacing -
was -
not -
used -
, -
because -
he -
converted -
to -
normal -
sinus -
rhythm -
by -
electrical -
defibrillation -
within -
three -
minutes -

We -
conclude -
that -
cardiac -
pacing -
during -
resuscitative -
efforts -
in -
pediatric -
patients -
suffering -
from -
acute -
myocardial D009202

may -

DISCUSSION -
: -
An -

However -
, -
administration -

the -

These -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Four -
studies -
published -
since -
December -
, -
1995 -
, -
reported -
that -
the -
incidence -
of -
venous D054556
thromboembolism -
( -
VTE D054556
) -
was -
higher -
in -
women -
who -
used -
oral -
contraceptives -
( -
OCs -
) -
containing -
the -
third -
- -
generation -
progestagens -
gestodene -
or -
desogestrel -
than -
in -
users -
of -
OCs -
containing -
second -
- -

. -

However -
, -
confounding -
and -
bias -
in -
the -
design -
of -
these -
studies -
may -
have -
affected -
the -
findings -
. -

The -
aim -
of -
our -
study -
was -
to -
re -
- -
examine -
the -

use -
with -

system -
is -
known -
to -
inhibit -

However -
, -
this -

was -
to -

and -
examine -
its -

After -

months -
of -

, -
dopamine -
( -
DA -
) -
concentrations -
in -
the -
median -

increased -
by -
84 -
% -
over -
the -

. -

Nine -
months -
of -
hyperprolactinemia D006966
produced -
a -
50 -
% -
increase -
in -
DA -
concentrations -
in -
the -
ME -
over -
the -
control -
group -
. -

However -
, -
DA -

was -
lost -
if -
a -
9 -

These -
results -
demonstrate -
that -
hyperprolactinemia D006966
specifically -
affects -

vary -
, -

We -

the -
concern -
about -

We -

is -
a -
valid -
therapeutic -
choice -
for -
patients -

OBJECTIVE -
: -
We -
wanted -
to -
test -
whether -

related -
signal -
( -

) -
allows -
for -
separation -
of -
central -
and -
peripheral -
effects -
of -
NSAIDs -
. -

For -
this -
purpose -
, -
experimental -
conditions -
were -
created -
in -
which -
NSAIDs -
had -
previously -
been -
observed -
to -
produce -
effects -
on -
phasic -
and -
tonic -
pain D010146
by -
either -
central -
or -
peripheral -
mechanisms -
. -

METHODS -
: -
According -

( -
11 -

) -
received -
either -
placebo -
, -
400 -
mg -
ibuprofen -
, -
or -
800 -
mg -

. -

Phasic -
pain D010146
was -
applied -
by -
means -
of -
short -
pulses -
of -

to -
the -
nasal -
mucosa -
( -
stimulus -
duration -
500 -
ms -
, -
interval -

) -
, -
and -
tonic -

was -
induced -
in -

. -

Both -
CSSEPs -
as -
central -
and -
NMPs -
as -
peripheral -
correlates -
of -
pain D010146
were -
obtained -
in -
response -
to -
the -
CO2 -
stimuli -
. -

Additionally -
, -
the -
subjects -
rated -
the -
intensity -
of -
both -
phasic -
and -
tonic -
pain D010146
by -
means -
of -
visual -
analogue -
scales -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
As -
described -
earlier -
, -
administration -
of -
ibuprofen -
was -
followed -
by -
a -
decrease -
in -
tonic -
pain D010146
but -
- -
relative -
to -
placebo -
- -
an -
increase -
in -
correlates -
of -
phasic -
pain D010146
, -
indicating -
a -
specific -
effect -
of -
ibuprofen -
on -
the -
interaction -
between -
the -
pain D010146
stimuli -
under -
these -
special -
experimental -
conditions -
. -

Based -
on -
the -
similar -
behaviour -
of -
CSSEP -
and -
NMP -
, -
it -
was -
concluded -
that -
the -
pharmacological -
process -
underlying -
this -
phenomenon -
was -
localised -
in -
the -
periphery -
. -

By -
means -
of -
the -
simultaneous -
recording -
of -
interrelated -
peripheral -
and -
central -
electrophysiologic -
correlates -
of -
nociception -
, -
it -
was -
possible -
to -
separate -
central -
and -
peripheral -
effects -
of -
an -
NSAID -
. -

The -
major -
advantage -
of -
this -
pain D010146
model -
is -
the -
possibility -
of -
obtaining -
peripheral -
pain D010146

A -
dopaminergic -
blockade -
mechanism -
generally -
is -
accepted -
as -
the -
pathogenesis -
of -
this -
syndrome -
. -

However -
, -
methylphenidate -
is -
a -
dopamine -
agonist -
via -
the -
inhibition -
of -
uptake -
of -
dopamine -
, -
and -
therefore -
dopaminergic -
systems -
in -
the -
brainstem -
( -
mainly -
the -
midbrain -
) -
and -
the -
spinal -
cord -
were -
unlikely -
to -
participate -
in -
the -
onset -
of -
this -
syndrome -
. -

A -
relative -
gamma -

. -

BACKGROUND -
: -
The -
use -
of -
appetite -
suppressants -
in -
Europe -
has -
been -
associated -
with -
the -
development -
of -
primary D006976
pulmonary -
hypertension -
( -
PPH D006976
) -
. -

Recently -
, -
fenfluramine -
appetite -
suppressants -
became -
widely -
used -
in -
the -
United -
States -
but -
were -
withdrawn -
in -
September -
1997 -
because -
of -
concerns -
over -
adverse -
effects -
. -

MATERIALS -
AND -
METHODS -
: -
We -
conducted -
a -
prospective -
surveillance -
study -
on -
patients -
diagnosed -
with -
pulmonary D006976
hypertension -
at -
12 -
large -
referral -
centers -
in -
North -
America -
. -

Data -
collected -
on -
patients -
seen -
from -
September -
1 -
, -
1996 -
, -
to -
December -
31 -
, -
1997 -
, -
included -
the -
cause -
of -
the -
pulmonary D006976
hypertension -
and -
its -
severity -
. -

Patients -
with -
no -
identifiable -
cause -
of -
pulmonary D006976
hypertension -
were -
classed -
as -
PPH D006976
. -

A -
history -
of -
drug -
exposure -
also -
was -
taken -
with -
special -
attention -
on -
the -
use -
of -
antidepressants -
, -
anorexigens -
, -
and -
amphetamines -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Five -
hundred -
seventy -
- -
nine -
patients -
were -
studied -
, -
205 -
with -
PPH D006976
and -
374 -
with -
pulmonary D006976
hypertension -
from -
other -
causes -
( -
secondary -
pulmonary D006976
hypertension -
[ -
SPH -
] -
) -
. -

The -
use -
of -
anorexigens -
was -
common -
in -
both -
groups -
. -

However -
, -
of -
the -
medications -
surveyed -
, -
only -
the -
fenfluramines -
had -
a -
significant -
preferential -
association -
with -
PPH D006976
as -
compared -
with -
SPH -

. -

The -
association -
was -
stronger -
with -
longer -
duration -
of -
use -
when -
compared -
to -
shorter -
duration -
of -
use -
and -
was -
more -
pronounced -
in -

than -
in -
remote -
users -
. -

An -
unexpectedly -
high -
( -
11 -
. -
4 -
% -
) -
number -
of -
patients -
with -
SPH -
had -
used -
anorexigens -
. -

CONCLUSION -
: -
The -
magnitude -
of -
the -
association -
with -
PPH D006976
, -
the -
increase -
of -
association -
with -
increasing -
duration -
of -
use -
, -
and -
the -
specificity -
for -
fenfluramines -
are -
consistent -
with -
previous -
studies -
indicating -
that -
fenfluramines -
are -
causally -
related -
to -
PPH D006976
. -

The -
high -
prevalence -
of -
anorexigen -
use -
in -
patients -
with -
SPH -
also -
raises -
the -
possibility -
that -
these -
drugs -
precipitate -
pulmonary D006976
hypertension -
in -
patients -
with -
underlying -
conditions -
associated -

Clinical -
aspects -
of -
heparin -
- -
induced -
thrombocytopenia D013921
and -
thrombosis D013927
and -
other -
side -
effects -
of -
heparin -
therapy -
. -

Heparin -
, -
first -
used -
to -
prevent -
the -
clotting -
of -
blood -
in -

, -
has -
been -
clinically -
used -
to -
treat -
thrombosis D013927
for -
more -
than -
50 -
years -
. -

Although -
several -
new -
anticoagulant -
drugs -
are -
in -
development -
, -
heparin -
remains -
the -
anticoagulant -
of -
choice -
to -
treat -
acute -
thrombotic D013927
episodes -
. -

The -
clinical -
effects -
of -
heparin -
are -
meritorious -
, -
but -
side -
effects -
do -
exist -
. -

Bleeding D006470
is -
the -
primary -
untoward -
effect -
of -
heparin -
. -

Major -
bleeding D006470
is -
of -
primary -
concern -
in -
patients -
receiving -
heparin -
therapy -
. -

However -
, -
additional -
important -
untoward -
effects -
of -
heparin -
therapy -
include -
heparin -
- -
induced -
thrombocytopenia D013921
, -
heparin -

, -
transaminasemia -
, -
hyperkalemia D006947
, -
hypoaldosteronism D006994
, -
and -
priapism D011317
. -

These -
side -
effects -
are -
relatively -
rare -
in -
a -
given -
individual -
, -
but -
given -
the -
extremely -
widespread -
use -
of -
heparin -
, -
some -
are -
quite -
common -
, -
particularly -
HITT D013921|D013927
and -

. -

Although -
reasonable -
incidences -
of -
many -

these -
side -
effects -
can -
be -
" -
softly -
" -
deduced -
from -

; -
however -
, -
there -
were -

PURPOSE -
: -
Prenatal -
cocaine -
exposure -
has -
been -
linked -
with -

the -
formation -
of -
cysts D003560
that -
are -
detectable -
on -

We -
sought -
to -
determine -
if -

increases -
the -
incidence -
of -
subependymal D001927|D003560

METHODS -
: -
We -
retrospectively -
reviewed -
the -

of -
2 -
groups -
: -
those -
exposed -
to -
cocaine -
and -
those -
not -
exposed -

Infants -
were -
assigned -
to -
the -

RESULTS -
: -
Five -
of -
the -
122 -
infants -
were -
excluded -
from -
the -
study -
because -
of -
insufficient -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
We -
found -
an -
increased -
incidence -
of -
subependymal D001927|D003560

( -
NCS -
) -
prior -

of -
its -
baseline -
, -
and -
the -
mean -

was -
termed -
the -
SNAP -
index -
. -

A -
40 -

decline -
in -
the -
SNAP -

was -
considered -
clinically -
significant -

Thalidomide -
was -

Six -
patients -
developed -
neuropathy D009422
. -

Clinical -
symptoms -
and -
a -
decline -
in -
the -
SNAP -
index -
occurred -
concurrently -
. -

Older -
age -
and -
cumulative -
dose -
were -
possible -
contributing -
factors -
. -

Neuropathy D009422
may -
thus -
be -
a -
common -
complication -
of -
thalidomide -
in -
older -
patients -
. -

The -
SNAP -

The -
participation -
of -

species -
in -

that -

that -
overexpression -
of -
Cu -

( -

In -
the -

, -
kanamycin -
increased -
the -
threshold -
by -
only -
15 -

over -
the -

The -
effects -
were -
similar -
at -
12 -
and -

The -
protection -
by -
overexpression -
of -

supports -
the -
hypothesis -
that -
oxidant -
stress -
plays -
a -
significant -
role -
in -

Myotonia D009224
congenita -
( -
MC D009224
) -
is -
caused -
by -
a -
defect -
in -
the -
skeletal -
muscle -
chloride -
channel -

, -
which -
may -
cause -

. -

When -

, -
she -
reported -

Myotonia D009222
was -
found -
on -

The -
diagnosis -

Neither -

PURPOSE -
: -
Apnea D001049
is -
known -
to -
occur -
during -
seizures D012640
, -
but -
systematic -
studies -
of -
ictal -

in -

are -
few -
. -

Data -
regarding -
respiratory -
pattern -
defects -
during -
interictal -
periods -
also -
are -
scarce -
. -

Here -
we -
sought -
to -
generate -
information -
with -
regard -
to -
the -
interictal -
period -
in -
animals -
with -
pilocarpine -
- -
induced -
epilepsy D004827
. -

METHODS -
: -
Twelve -
rats -
( -
six -
chronically -
epileptic D004827
animals -
and -
six -
controls -
) -
were -
anesthetized -
, -
given -
tracheotomies -
, -
and -
subjected -
to -
hyperventilation D006985
or -
hypoventilation -
conditions -
. -

Breathing -
movements -
caused -
changes -
in -
thoracic -
volume -
and -
forced -
air -
to -
flow -
tidally -
through -
a -
pneumotachograph -
. -

This -
flow -
was -
measured -
by -
using -
a -
differential -
pressure -
transducer -
, -
passed -
through -
a -
polygraph -
, -
and -
from -
this -
to -
a -

. -

RESULTS -
: -
The -
hyperventilation D006985
maneuver -
caused -
a -
decrease -
in -
spontaneous -
ventilation -
in -
pilocarpine -
- -
treated -
and -
control -
rats -
. -

Although -
VE -
had -
a -
similar -
decrease -
in -
both -
groups -
, -
in -
the -
epileptic D004827
group -
, -
the -
decrease -
in -
VE -
was -
due -
to -
a -
significant -
( -
p -
< -
0 -
. -
05 -
) -
increase -
in -
TE -
peak -
in -
relation -
to -
that -
of -
the -
control -
animals -
. -

The -
hypoventilation -
maneuver -
led -
to -
an -
increase -
in -
the -
arterial -
Paco2 -
, -
followed -
by -
an -
increase -
in -
VE -
. -

In -
the -
epileptic D004827
group -
, -
the -
increase -
in -
VE -
was -
mediated -
by -
a -
significant -
( -
p -
< -
0 -
. -
05 -
) -
decrease -
in -
TE -
peak -
compared -
with -
the -
control -
group -
. -

Systemic -
application -
of -
KCN -
, -
to -
evaluate -
the -
effects -
of -
peripheral -
chemoreception -
activation -
on -
ventilation -
, -
led -
to -
a -
similar -
increase -
in -
VE -
for -
both -
groups -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
The -
data -
indicate -
that -
pilocarpine -
- -
treated -
animals -
have -
an -
altered -
ability -
to -
react -
to -
( -
or -
compensate -
for -
) -
blood -
gas -
changes -
with -
changes -
in -
ventilation -
and -
suggest -
that -
it -
is -
centrally -

To -
gain -

into -
the -

were -

Many -

The -

indicates -
that -
the -

were -
indirect -

Based -
upon -
these -
results -
, -
we -
conclude -
that -
amiodarone -
disrupts -
hepatic -
lipid -

and -
that -
the -

Lithium -

By -

the -
physical -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Acetaminophen -
( -
paracetamol -
- -
- -
P -
) -
and -
Nimesulide -
( -
N -
) -
are -
widely -
used -
analgesic -

anti -
- -
inflammatory -
drugs -
. -

The -
rate -
of -
adverse -
hypersensitivity D004342
reactions -
to -
these -
agents -
is -
generally -
low -
. -

On -
the -
contrary -
non -
- -
steroidal -
anti -
- -
inflammatory -
drugs -
( -
NSAIDs -
) -
are -
commonly -
involved -
in -
such -
reactions -
. -

Celecoxib -
( -

) -
is -
a -
novel -
drug -
, -
with -
high -
selectivity -
and -
affinity -
for -
COX -
- -
2 -
enzyme -
. -

OBJECTIVE -
: -
We -
evaluated -
the -
tolerability -
of -
CE -
in -
a -
group -
of -
patients -
with -
documented -
history -
of -
adverse -
cutaneous D003875
reactions -
to -
P -
and -
N -
associated -
or -
not -
to -
classic -
NSAIDs -
. -

METHODS -
: -
We -
studied -
9 -
patients -
with -
hypersensitivity D004342
to -
P -
and -
N -
with -
or -
without -
associated -
reactions -
to -
classic -
NSAIDs -
. -

The -
diagnosis -
of -
P -
and -
N -
- -
induced -
skin D003875
reactions -
was -
based -
in -
vivo -
challenge -
. -

The -
placebo -
was -
blindly -
administered -
at -
the -
beginning -
of -
each -
challenge -
. -

After -
three -
days -
, -
a -
cumulative -
dosage -
of -
200 -
mg -
of -
CE -
in -
refracted -
doses -
were -
given -
. -

After -
2 -
- -
3 -
days -
, -
a -
single -
dose -
of -
200 -
mg -
was -
administered -
. -

All -
patients -
were -
observed -
for -
6 -
hours -
after -
each -
challenge -
, -
and -
controlled -
again -
after -
24 -
hours -
to -
exclude -
delayed -
reactions -
. -

The -
challenge -
was -
considered -
positive -
if -
one -
or -
more -
of -
the -
following -
appeared -
: -
erythema D004890
, -
rush -
or -
urticaria D014581
- -
angioedema D000799
. -

RESULTS -
: -
No -
reaction -
was -
observed -
with -
placebo -
and -
eight -
patients -
( -
88 -
. -
8 -
% -
) -
tolerated -
CE -
. -

Only -
one -
patient -
developed -
a -
moderate -
angioedema D000799
of -
the -
lips -
. -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Only -
one -
hypersensitivity D004342
reaction -
to -
CE -
was -
documented -
among -
9 -
P -
and -
N -
- -
highly -
NSAIDs -
intolerant -
patients -
. -

Thus -
, -
we -
conclude -
that -
CE -
is -
a -
reasonably -
safe -
alternative -
to -
be -
used -
in -
subjects -
who -
do -
not -
tolerate -

was -
related -
to -
the -

oxidative -
stress -
that -

? -

There -
is -
now -
evidence -
to -
suggest -
a -
central -
role -
for -
the -
dopaminergic -
system -
in -
restless D012148
legs -
syndrome -
( -
RLS D012148
) -
. -

For -
example -
, -
the -
symptoms -
of -
RLS D012148
can -
be -
dramatically -
improved -
by -
levodopa -
and -
dopamine -
agonists -
, -
whereas -
central -
dopamine -
D2 -
receptor -
antagonists -
can -
induce -
or -
aggravate -
RLS D012148
symptoms -
. -

To -
our -
knowledge -
, -
there -
is -
no -
previous -
report -
regarding -
whether -
domperidone -
, -
a -
peripheral -
dopamine -

antagonist -
, -
can -
also -
induce -
or -

Mirtazapine -
, -
the -
first -
noradrenergic -
and -

) -
, -
has -
been -
associated -
with -
RLS D012148
in -
several -
recent -
publications -

The -
authors -
report -
here -
a -
depressed -
patient -
comorbid -
with -
postprandial D004415
dyspepsia -
who -
developed -
RLS D012148
after -
mirtazapine -
had -
been -
added -
to -
his -
domperidone -
therapy -
. -

Our -
patient -
started -
to -
have -
symptoms -
of -
RLS D012148
only -
after -
he -
had -
been -
treated -
with -
mirtazapine -
, -
and -
his -
RLS D012148
symptoms -
resolved -
completely -
upon -
discontinuation -
of -
his -
mirtazapine -
. -

Such -
a -

between -
the -
use -
of -
mirtazapine -
and -
the -
symptoms -
of -

However -
, -
physicians -
should -
be -
aware -

the -
possibility -
that -

be -

Cardiotoxicity D066126
is -
a -
rare -
complication -

We -
herein -
report -
the -
case -
of -
a -
70 -
- -
year -
- -
old -
man -
with -
5 -
- -
FU -
- -
induced -
cardiotoxicity D066126
, -
in -
whom -
a -
high -
serum -
level -
of -
alpha -
- -
fluoro -
- -
beta -
- -
alanine -
( -
FBAL -
) -
was -
observed -
. -

The -
patient -
, -
who -
had -
unresectable -
colon D003110
cancer -
metastases -
to -
the -
liver -
and -
lung -
, -
was -
referred -
to -
us -
for -
chemotherapy -
from -
an -
affiliated -
hospital -
; -
he -
had -
no -
cardiac -
history -
. -

After -
admission -
, -
the -
patient -
received -
a -
continuous -
intravenous -
infusion -
of -
5 -
- -
FU -
( -
1000 -
mg -
/ -
day -
) -
, -
during -
which -
precordial D002637
pain -
with -
right D002037
bundle -

block -
occurred -
concomitantly -
with -
a -
high -
serum -
FBAL -
concentration -
of -
1955 -
ng -
/ -
ml -
. -

Both -
the -
precordial D002637
pain -
and -
the -
electrocardiographic -
changes -
disappeared -
spontaneously -
after -
the -
discontinuation -
of -
5 -
- -
FU -
. -

As -
the -
precordial D002637
pain -
in -
this -
patient -
was -
considered -
to -
have -
been -
due -
to -
5 -
- -
FU -
- -
induced -
cardiotoxicity D066126
, -
the -
administration -
of -
5 -
- -
FU -
was -
abandoned -
. -

Instead -
, -
oral -
administration -
of -
S -
- -
1 -
( -
a -
derivative -
of -
5 -
- -
FU -
) -
, -
at -
200 -
mg -
/ -
day -
twice -
a -
week -
, -
was -
instituted -
, -
because -
S -
- -
1 -
has -
a -
strong -
inhibitory -
effect -
on -
dihydropyrimidine -
dehydrogenase -
, -
which -
catalyzes -
the -
degradative -
of -
5 -
- -
FU -
into -
FBAL -
. -

The -
serum -
FBAL -
concentration -
subsequently -
decreased -
to -
352 -
ng -
/ -
ml -
, -
the -
same -
as -
the -
value -
measured -
on -
the -
first -
day -
of -
S -
- -
1 -
administration -
. -

Thereafter -
, -
no -
cardiac D009461
symptoms -
were -
observed -
. -

The -
patient -
achieved -
a -
partial -
response -
6 -
months -
after -
the -
initiation -
of -
the -
S -
- -
1 -
treatment -
. -

The -
experience -
of -
this -
case -
, -
together -
with -
a -
review -
of -
the -
literature -
, -
suggests -
that -
FBAL -
is -
related -
to -
5 -
- -
FU -
- -
induced -
cardiotoxicity D066126
. -

S -
- -

on -
the -
protection -

. -

PURPOSE -
: -
Despite -
its -
well -
- -
known -
cardiotoxicity D066126
, -
the -
anthracyclin -
doxorubicin -
( -
DOX -
) -
continues -
to -
be -
an -
effective -
and -
widely -
used -
chemotherapeutic -
agent -
. -

DOX -
- -
induced -
cardiac D006331
damage -
presumably -
results -
from -
the -
formation -
of -
free -
radicals -
by -
DOX -
. -

Reactive -
oxygen -
species -
particularly -
affect -
the -
cardiac -
myocytes -
because -
these -
cells -
seem -
to -
have -
a -
relatively -
poor -
antioxidant -
defense -
system -
. -

The -
semisynthetic -
flavonoid -
monohydroxyethylrutoside -
( -
monoHER -
) -
showed -
cardioprotection -
against -
DOX -
- -
induced -
cardiotoxicity D066126
through -
its -
radical -
scavenging -
and -
iron -
chelating -
properties -
. -

Because -
of -
the -
relatively -
short -
final -
half -
- -
life -
of -
monoHER -
( -
about -
30 -
min -
) -
, -
it -
is -
expected -
that -
the -
time -
interval -
between -
monoHER -
and -
DOX -
might -
be -
of -
influence -
on -
the -
cardioprotective -
effect -
of -
monoHER -
. -

Therefore -
, -
the -
aim -
of -
the -
present -
study -
was -
to -
investigate -
this -
possible -
effect -
. -

METHODS -

Regular -

has -
many -
benefits -
for -

condition -
but -
its -
implications -
for -
epilepsy D004827
are -
still -
controversial -
. -

In -
order -
to -
elucidate -
this -
problem -
, -
we -
have -
studied -
the -
effect -
of -
long -
- -
term -
physical -
activity -
on -
susceptibility -
to -
subsequent -
seizures D012640
. -

Male -
Wistar -
rats -
were -
subjected -
to -
repeated -
training -
sessions -
in -
a -
treadmill -
and -
swimming -
pool -
. -

Thereafter -
, -
seizures D012640
were -
induced -
by -
pilocarpine -
injections -
in -
trained -
and -
non -

trained -
control -
groups -
. -

During -
the -
acute -
period -
of -
status D013226
epilepticus -
, -
we -
measured -
: -
( -
1 -
) -
the -
latency -
of -
the -
first -
motor -
sign -
, -
( -
2 -

the -
intensity -

period -
, -
and -
( -

) -
the -
time -
when -
the -
acute -
period -
ended -
. -

All -
these -
behavioral -
parameters -
showed -
statistically -
significant -
changes -
suggesting -
that -
regular -
physical -
exercises -
decrease -
susceptibility -
to -
subsequently -

seizures D012640
and -
ameliorate -
the -

of -
the -
dopamine -
precursor -
levodopa -
enhances -

Because -
levodopa -
increases -
both -
phasic -
and -
tonic -
dopaminergic -
neurotransmission -
, -
the -
critical -
mechanism -
mediating -
the -
enhancement -
of -
learning -
is -
unresolved -
. -

We -
here -
probed -
how -
selective -
tonic -
dopaminergic -
stimulation -
affects -
associative -
learning -
. -

Forty -
healthy -
subjects -
were -
trained -
in -
a -
novel -
vocabulary -
of -
45 -
concrete -
nouns -
over -
the -
course -

double -

Subjects -
received -
the -
tonically -
stimulating -
dopamine -
- -
receptor -
agonist -
pergolide -
( -
0 -
. -
1 -
mg -
) -
vs -
placebo -
120 -
min -
before -
training -
on -
each -
training -
day -
. -

The -
dopamine -
agonist -
significantly -
impaired D007859
novel -
word -
learning -
compared -
to -
placebo -
. -

This -
learning -
decrement -
persisted -
up -
to -
the -
last -
follow -
- -
up -
4 -
weeks -
post -
- -
training -
. -

Subjects -
treated -
with -
pergolide -
also -
showed -
restricted -
emotional -
responses -
compared -
to -
the -
PLACEBO -
group -
. -

The -
extent -
of -
' -
flattened -
' -
affect -
with -
pergolide -
was -
related -
to -
the -
degree -
of -
learning -
inhibition -
. -

These -
findings -
suggest -
that -
tonic -
occupation -
of -
dopamine -
receptors -
impairs -
learning -
by -
competition -
with -
phasic -
dopamine -
signals -
. -

Thus -
, -
phasic -
signaling -
seems -
to -
be -
the -
critical -
mechanism -
by -
which -
dopamine -
enhances -
associative -
learning -
in -
healthy -
subjects -
and -

Chloroacetaldehyde -
( -

) -
is -
a -
metabolite -
of -
the -
alkylating -
agent -
ifosfamide -
( -

In -

the -
effect -
of -
CAA -
on -
human -
proximal -

cells -
in -
primary -
culture -
( -
hRPTEC -

was -
investigated -
. -

Toxicity D064420
of -
CAA -
was -
determined -
by -
protein -

, -
LDH -

, -

and -
caspase -

Free -

were -
measured -
by -
the -
method -
of -
Ellman -

CAA -
reduced -

induced -
a -

CAA -
but -

inhibited -
the -
cysteine -
proteases -
caspase -
- -

, -
caspase -
- -

and -
cathepsin -
B -
. -

Caspase -
activation -
by -
cisplatin -
was -
inhibited -
by -
CAA -
. -

In -
cells -
stained -
with -
fluorescent -
dyes -
targeting -
lysosomes -
, -
CAA -
induced -
an -
increase -
in -
lysosomal -
size -
and -
lysosomal -

. -

The -
effects -
of -
CAA -
on -
cysteine -
protease -
activities -
and -
thiols -
could -
be -
reproduced -
in -
cell -
lysate -
. -

Acidification -
, -
which -
slowed -
the -
reaction -
of -
CAA -
with -
thiol -

, -
could -
also -
attenuate -
effects -

on -

markers -
, -
thiol -
depletion -
and -
cysteine -
protease -

in -

Thus -
, -
CAA -
directly -
reacts -
with -
cellular -
protein -
and -
non -
- -
protein -
thiols -
, -
mediating -
its -
toxicity D064420
on -
hRPTEC -
. -

This -
effect -
can -
be -
reduced -
by -
acidification -
. -

Therefore -
, -
urinary -
acidification -
could -
be -
an -
option -
to -
prevent -

Following -
status D013226
epilepticus -
in -
the -
rat -
, -
dentate -
granule -
cell -
neurogenesis -
increases -
greatly -
, -
and -
many -
of -
the -
new -
neurons -
appear -
to -
develop -
ectopically -
, -
in -
the -
hilar -
region -
of -
the -
hippocampal -
formation -
. -

It -
has -
been -
suggested -
that -
the -
ectopic -
hilar -
granule -
cells -
could -
contribute -
to -
the -
spontaneous -
seizures D012640
that -
ultimately -
develop -
after -
status D013226
epilepticus -
. -

However -
, -
the -
population -
has -
never -
been -
quantified -
, -
so -
it -
is -
unclear -
whether -
it -
is -
substantial -
enough -
to -
have -
a -
strong -
influence -
on -
epileptogenesis -
. -

To -
quantify -
this -
population -
, -
the -
total -
number -
of -
ectopic -
hilar -

cells -
was -
estimated -
using -
unbiased -
stereology -
at -

a -
granule -

- -
specific -

, -
was -
estimated -
using -
the -
optical -

The -
results -
indicate -
that -
the -
size -
of -
the -
hilar -
ectopic -
granule -
cell -
population -
after -
status D013226
epilepticus -
is -
substantial -
, -
and -
stable -
over -
time -
. -

Interestingly -
, -
the -
size -
of -
the -
population -
appears -
to -
be -
correlated -
with -
the -
frequency -
of -
behavioral -
seizures D012640
, -
because -
animals -
with -
more -
ectopic -
granule -
cells -
in -
the -
hilus -
have -
more -
frequent -
behavioral -
seizures D012640
. -

The -
hilar -
ectopic -
granule -
cell -
population -
does -
not -
appear -
to -
vary -
systematically -
across -
the -
septotemporal -
axis -
, -
although -
it -
is -
associated -
with -
an -
increase -
in -
volume -
of -

The -
results -
provide -
new -
insight -
into -

BACKGROUND -
: -
There -
is -
growing -
pressure -
for -
clinicians -
to -
prescribe -
chelation -
therapy -
at -
only -
slightly -
elevated -
blood -
lead -
levels -
. -

However -
, -
very -
few -
studies -
have -
evaluated -
whether -
chelation -
improves -
cognitive -
outcomes -
in -
Pb -
- -
exposed -
children -
, -
or -
whether -
these -
agents -
have -
adverse -
effects -
that -
may -
affect -
brain -
development -
in -
the -
absence -
of -

exposure -
. -

OBJECTIVES -
: -
The -
present -
study -
was -
designed -
to -
answer -
these -
questions -
, -
using -
a -
rodent -
model -
of -
early -
childhood -
Pb -
exposure -
and -
treatment -
with -
succimer -
, -
a -
widely -
used -
chelating -
agent -
for -
the -
treatment -
of -
Pb D007855
poisoning -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Pb -
exposure -
produced -
lasting -
impairments D007859|D019958
in -
learning -
, -
attention -
, -
inhibitory -
control -
, -
and -
arousal -
regulation -
, -
paralleling -
the -
areas -
of -

seen -
in -

- -
exposed -

. -

Succimer -
treatment -
of -
the -
Pb -
- -
exposed -
rats -
significantly -
improved -
learning -
, -
attention -
, -
and -
arousal -
regulation -
, -
although -
the -
efficacy -
of -
the -
treatment -
varied -
as -
a -
function -
of -
the -
Pb -
exposure -
level -
and -
the -
specific -
functional -
deficit -
. -

In -
contrast -
, -
succimer -
treatment -
of -
rats -
not -
previously -
exposed -
to -
Pb -
produced -
lasting -
and -
pervasive -
cognitive D003072|D019964
and -
affective -
dysfunction -
comparable -
in -
magnitude -
to -
that -
produced -
by -
the -
higher -
Pb -
exposure -
regimen -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
These -
are -
the -
first -
data -
, -
to -
our -
knowledge -
, -
to -
show -
that -
treatment -
with -
any -
chelating -
agent -
can -
alleviate -
cognitive D003072
deficits -
due -
to -
Pb -
exposure -
. -

These -
findings -
suggest -
that -
it -
may -
be -
possible -
to -
identify -
a -
succimer -
treatment -
protocol -
that -
improves -
cognitive -
outcomes -
in -
Pb -
- -
exposed -
children -
. -

However -
, -
they -
also -
suggest -
that -
succimer -
treatment -
should -
be -
strongly -
discouraged -
for -
children -
who -
do -
not -
have -
elevated -

METHODS -
: -
This -
prospective -
study -
included -
28 -
patients -
undergoing -
carotid -
endarterectomy -
under -
local -
anesthesia -
. -

Vocal -
cord -

was -
evaluated -
before -
, -
during -
, -
and -
after -
surgery -
( -
postoperative -
day -

) -
using -
flexible -
laryngoscopy -
. -

Anesthesia -
was -
performed -
by -
injecting -
20 -

40 -
mL -
of -
a -
mixture -
of -
long -

RESULTS -
: -
All -
patients -
had -
normal -
vocal -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Local -
anesthesia -
led -
to -
temporary -

in -
almost -
half -
of -

, -
a -
preoperative -
evaluation -

Histopathologically -

Malondialdehyde -
level -
in -
BCNU -
- -

was -
higher -
than -
those -
in -

in -
BCNU -
group -
( -

, -
while -
there -
were -
no -
significant -
differences -
in -
the -

between -
these -
groups -
. -

These -
data -
suggest -
that -
exposure -
of -
animals -
to -
BCNU -
during -
pregnancy -
leads -
to -
delayed -
maturation -
of -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Azathioprine -
is -
widely -
used -
as -
an -
immunosuppressive -
drug -
. -

The -
side -
effects -
of -
azathioprine -
include -
anemia D000740
, -
which -
has -
been -
attributed -
to -
bone -
marrow -
suppression -
. -

Alternatively -
, -
anemia D000740
could -
result -
from -
accelerated -
suicidal -
erythrocyte -
death -
or -
eryptosis -
, -
which -
is -
characterized -
by -
exposure -
of -
phosphatidylserine -
( -
PS -
) -
at -
the -
erythrocyte -
surface -
and -
by -
cell -

. -

METHODS -
: -
The -
present -
experiments -
explored -
whether -
azathioprine -
influences -

were -
determined -
by -

He -
had -

and -
had -
used -
150 -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Those -
using -
methadone -
and -
heroin -
simultaneously -
may -
increase -
risk -
of -
rhabdomyolysis D012206
and -
ischemic D002544

levels -
and -
iNOS -
protein -
expression -
in -
the -

. -

Treatment -
with -
L -
- -
DOPA -

benserazide -
( -

resulted -
in -
less -
severe -
dyskinesias D004409
in -
CB1 -

than -
in -
WT -
mice -
. -

The -
results -
revealed -
that -
the -
lack -
of -
cannabinoid -
CB1 -
receptors -
increased -
the -
severity -
of -
motor -
impairment -
and -
DA -
lesion -
, -
and -
reduced -
L -
- -
DOPA -
- -
induced -
dyskinesias D004409

These -
results -
suggest -
that -
activation -
of -

offers -
neuroprotection -
against -

, -
we -
observed -
that -
the -

DISCUSSION -
: -
Flecainide -
and -
pharmacologically -

INTERPRETATION -
: -
Smoking -
of -
crack -
cocaine -
was -
found -
to -
be -
an -
independent -
risk -
factor -
for -
HIV D006679
seroconversion -
among -
people -
who -
were -
injection -
drug -
users -
. -

This -
finding -
points -
to -
the -
urgent -
need -
for -
evidence -
- -
based -
public -
health -
initiatives -
targeted -
at -
people -
who -
smoke -
crack -

A -
widely -

chemotherapeutic -
agent -
, -
5 -
- -
fluorouracil -
( -
5 -

FU -
) -
, -
readily -
crosses -
the -
blood -
- -
brain -
barrier -
and -
so -
could -
have -
a -
direct -
effect -
on -
brain -
function -
. -

In -
particular -
this -
anti -
mitotic -
drug -
could -
reduce -
cell -
proliferation -
in -
the -
neurogenic -
regions -
of -
the -
adult -
brain -
. -

In -
contrast -
reports -
indicate -
that -
hippocampal -
dependent -
neurogenesis -
and -
cognition -
are -
enhanced -
by -
the -
SSRI -
antidepressant -
Fluoxetine -
. -

In -
this -
investigation -
the -
behavioural -
effects -
of -
chronic -
( -

in -

with -
5 -
- -

were -
tested -
on -

Behavioural -
effects -
were -
tested -
using -
a -
context -
dependent -
conditioned -
emotional -
response -
test -
( -
CER -
) -
which -
showed -
that -
animals -
treated -
with -
5 -
- -
FU -
had -
a -
significant -
reduction -
in -
freezing -
time -
compared -
to -
controls -
. -

A -
separate -
group -
of -
animals -
was -
tested -
using -
a -
hippocampal -
dependent -
spatial -
working -
memory -
test -
, -
the -
object -
location -

test -
( -
OLR -
) -
. -

Animals -
treated -
only -
with -
5 -
- -
FU -
showed -
significant -
deficits -
in -
their -
ability -
to -
carry -
out -
the -
OLR -
task -
but -
co -
administration -
of -
Fluoxetine -
improved -
their -
performance -
. -

5 -
- -
FU -
chemotherapy -
caused -
a -
significant -
reduction -
in -
the -
number -
of -
proliferating -
cells -
in -
the -
sub -
granular -
zone -
of -
the -
dentate -
gyrus -
compared -
to -
controls -
. -

This -
reduction -
was -
eliminated -
when -
Fluoxetine -
was -
co -
administered -
with -
5 -
- -
FU -
. -

Fluoxetine -
on -
its -
own -
had -
no -
effect -
on -
proliferating -
cell -
number -
or -
behaviour -
. -

These -
findings -
suggest -
that -
5 -
- -
FU -
can -
negatively -
affect -
both -
cell -
proliferation -
and -
hippocampal -
dependent -
working -
memory -
and -
that -
these -
deficits -
can -
be -
reversed -
by -
the -
simultaneous -
administration -
of -
the -
antidepressant -
Fluoxetine -

Heparin -
- -

thrombocytopenia D013921
( -
HIT D013921
) -
remains -
under -
- -
recognized -
despite -
its -
potentially -
devastating -
outcomes -
. -

It -
begins -
when -
heparin -
exposure -
stimulates -
the -
formation -
of -
heparin -
- -
platelet -
factor -
4 -
antibodies -
, -
which -
in -
turn -
triggers -
the -
release -

that -

comprise -
the -
2 -
hallmark -
traits -
of -
HIT D013921
, -
with -
the -
former -
largely -
responsible -
for -
significant -
vascular -
complications -
. -

The -
prevalence -
of -
HIT D013921
varies -
among -
several -
subgroups -
, -
with -
greater -
incidence -
in -
surgical -
as -
compared -
with -
medical -
populations -
. -

HIT D013921
must -
be -
acknowledged -
for -
its -
intense -
predilection -
for -
thrombosis D013927
and -
suspected -
whenever -
thrombosis D013927
occurs -
after -
heparin -
exposure -
. -

Early -
recognition -
that -
incorporates -
the -
clinical -
and -
serologic -
clues -
is -
paramount -
to -
timely -
institution -
of -
treatment -
, -
as -
its -
delay -
may -
result -
in -
catastrophic -
outcomes -
. -

The -
treatment -
of -
HIT D013921
mandates -
an -
immediate -
cessation -
of -
all -
heparin -
exposure -
and -
the -
institution -
of -
an -
antithrombotic -
therapy -
, -
most -
commonly -
using -
a -
direct -
thrombin -
inhibitor -
. -

Current -
" -
diagnostic -
" -
tests -
, -
which -
primarily -
include -
functional -
and -
antigenic -
assays -
, -
have -
more -
of -
a -
confirmatory -
than -
diagnostic -
role -
in -
the -
management -
of -
HIT D013921
. -

Special -
attention -
must -
be -
paid -
to -
cardiac -
patients -
who -
are -
often -
exposed -
to -
heparin -
multiple -
times -
during -
their -
course -
of -
treatment -
. -

Direct -
thrombin -
inhibitors -
are -
appropriate -
, -
evidence -
- -
based -
alternatives -
to -
heparin -
in -
patients -
with -
a -
history -
of -
HIT D013921
, -
who -
need -
to -
undergo -
percutaneous -
coronary -
intervention -
. -

As -
heparin -
remains -
one -
of -
the -
most -
frequently -
used -
medications -
today -
with -
potential -
for -
HIT D013921
with -
every -
heparin -

a -
close -
vigilance -
of -
platelet -

Prevention -

The -
goal -
of -
this -

in -
an -
experimental -
model -
of -

We -
hypothesized -
that -
cocaine D019970
abuse -
may -
lead -
to -
altered -
mitochondrial -
function -
that -
in -
turn -
may -
cause -

ventricular -
dysfunction -
. -

Seven -
days -
of -
cocaine -
administration -
to -
rats -
led -
to -
an -
increased -
oxygen -
consumption -
detected -
in -
cardiac -
fibers -
, -
specifically -
through -
complex -
I -
and -
complex -

. -

ROS -
levels -
were -
increased -
, -
specifically -
in -

mitochondria -
. -

In -
parallel -
there -
was -
a -
decrease -
in -
ATP -
synthesis -
, -
whereas -
no -
difference -
was -
observed -
in -
subsarcolemmal -

This -
uncoupling -
effect -
on -
oxidative -
phosphorylation -
was -
not -
detectable -
after -
short -
- -
term -
exposure -
to -
cocaine -
, -
suggesting -
that -
these -
mitochondrial D028361
abnormalities -
were -
a -
late -
rather -
than -
a -
primary -
event -
in -
the -
pathological -
response -
to -

MitoQ -
, -
a -
mitochondrial -
- -
targeted -

, -
was -
shown -
to -
completely -
prevent -
these -

and -
their -
prognosis -
is -
poor -

However -
, -
a -

has -
been -
recently -
reported -
in -

Here -
we -
had -
the -
opportunity -
to -
study -
a -
case -
of -
refractory -
MCL D020522
who -
had -
tumor D009369
regression -
two -
months -
after -
temsirolimus -
treatment -
, -
and -
a -
progression -
- -
free -
survival -
of -
10 -
months -
. -

In -
this -
case -
, -
lymph -
node -
biopsies -
were -
performed -
before -
and -
six -
months -
after -
temsirolimus -
therapy -
. -

Comparison -
of -
the -
two -
biopsies -
showed -
that -
temsirolimus -
inhibited -
tumor D009369
cell -
proliferation -
through -
cell -
cycle -
arrest -
, -
but -
did -
not -
induce -
any -
change -
in -
the -
number -
of -
apoptotic -
tumor D009369
cells -
. -

Apart -
from -
this -
cytostatic -
effect -
, -
temsirolimus -
had -
an -
antiangiogenic -
effect -
with -
decrease -
of -
tumor D009369
microvessel -
density -
and -
of -
VEGF -
expression -
. -

Moreover -
, -
numerous -
patchy -
, -
well -
- -
limited -
fibrotic -
areas -
, -
compatible -
with -
post -

necrotic D009336
tissue -
repair -
, -
were -
found -
after -
6 -
- -
month -
temsirolimus -
therapy -
. -

Thus -
, -
temsirolimus -
reduced -
tumor D009369
burden -
through -
associated -
cytostatic -
and -
anti -
- -
angiogenic -
effects -
. -
This -
dual -
effect -
of -
temsirolimus -
on -
tumor D009369
tissue -
could -
contribute -
to -
its -
recently -

The -
cause -

to -
be -
several -

in -
addition -
to -
the -
long -

case -
is -
a -
good -
example -
of -
electrolyte -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Osteoporosis D010024
is -
caused -
by -
bone -
resorption -
in -
excess -
of -
bone -
formation -
, -
and -
bisphosphonates -
, -
are -
used -
to -
inhibit -
bone -
resorption -
. -

Alendronate -
, -
a -
biphosphonate -
, -
is -
effective -
for -
both -
the -
treatment -
and -
prevention -
of -

CONCLUSION -
: -
We -
conclude -
that -
